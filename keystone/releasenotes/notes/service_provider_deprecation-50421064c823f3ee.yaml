deprecations:
  - service_provider parameter is deprecated, does nothing and will be removed in a future release.
    The parameter has no effect. The Service provider will be found by Puppet itself.
    If you really need to override this value, please use a Puppet resource collector,
    using keystone-service resource tag.
