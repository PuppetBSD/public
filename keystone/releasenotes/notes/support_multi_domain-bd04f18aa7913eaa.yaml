prelude: >
    Support for multi-domain has been added.  You can configure LDAP
    identity drivers along with the sql, and have multi-domain
    working.
features:
  - Support for multi-domain;
  - Remove prefetch in keystone_user/keystone_user_role
upgrade:
  - The prefetch and associated instances class function removal
    could impact users that somehow use the command `puppet resource
    keystone_user` or `puppet resource keystone_user_role` in
    production.  Those commands won't work anymore.  Directly use
    the associated `openstack` commands to get the same effect.
fixes:
  - Fixes `bug 1554555
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/puppet-keystone/+bug/1554555>`__ so
    openstack cli provider needs to pass domain in v3 calls
  - Fixes `bug 1485508
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/puppet-keystone/+bug/1485508>`__ so
    when domain_specific_drivers_enabled=True keystone_user provider fails.
