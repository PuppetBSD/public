features:
  - keystone-manage can be used to setup Keystone credentials.  Disabled by default
    as long as the proper version of keystone is not in UCA.
    It has been a requirement in Keystone upstream so puppet-keystone will support the
    management of credential directory, keystone-manage credential_setup execution (can
    be enabled with enable_credential_setup boolean) and the configuration of
    credential/key_repository in keystone.conf.
    Note, if credential_keys parameter is set to a valid hash, keystone-manage won't
    be used to generate credential keys but Puppet will manage file resources for each
    key in the hash. It allows to generate the same keys in multinode environment.
