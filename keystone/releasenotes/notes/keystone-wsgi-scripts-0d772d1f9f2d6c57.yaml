deprecations:
  - The single wsgi script for both the keystone admin and
    public endpoints have been deprecated upstream. As such,
    our support of a single wsgi script for keystone is also
    deprecated.
other:
  - Add support for the newer admin and public wsgi scripts
    for keystone. Also added is the ability to provide a custom
    script for each of these. By default, the module will leverage
    scripts provided by the keystone package.
