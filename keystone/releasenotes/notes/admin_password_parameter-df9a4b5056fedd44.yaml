  - admin_password is now an argument to the main class.
    This is needed because keystone-manage bootstrap
    should be taking the admin_password, not the admin_token.
    The admin_password will initially default to the
    value of the admin_token, but the admin_token is
    on a path to deprecation and is already deprecated
    in Keystone itself, so do not rely on the default.
