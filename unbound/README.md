# Puppet powered DNS with Unbound

[![Puppet Forge](https://img.shields.io/puppetforge/v/zleslie/unbound.svg)]() [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xaque208/puppet-unbound.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xaque208/puppet-unbound)

A puppet module for the Unbound caching resolver.

## Supported Platforms

* Debian
* FreeBSD
* OpenBSD
* OS X (macports)
* RHEL clones (with EPEL)
* openSUSE (local repo or obs://server:dns)

## Requirements

### concat

The `concat` module must be installed. It can be obtained from Puppet Forge:

```
    puppet module install puppetlabs/concat
```

Or add this line to your `Puppetfile` and deploy with [R10k](https://github.com/adrienthebo/r10k):

```Ruby
    mod 'concat', :git => 'git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-concat.git'
```

### stdlib

The `stdlib` module must be installed. It can be obtained from Puppet Forge:

```
    puppet module install puppetlabs-stdlib
```

Or add this line to your `Puppetfile` and deploy with [R10k](https://github.com/adrienthebo/r10k):

```Ruby
    mod 'stdlib', :git => 'git://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib.git'
```

## Usage

### Server Setup

At minimum you should setup the interfaces to listen on and allow access to a few subnets.

```puppet
    class { "unbound":
      interface => ["::0","0.0.0.0"],
      access    => ["10.0.0.0/20","::1"],
    }
```

Or, using hiera
```yaml
unbound::interface:
  - '::0'
  - '0.0.0.0'
unbound::access:
  - '10.0.0.0/20'
  - '::1'
```

### Stub Zones

These are zones for which you have an authoritative name server and want to
direct queries.

```puppet
    unbound::stub { "lan.example.com":
      address  => '10.0.0.10',
      insecure => true,
    }

    unbound::stub { "0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.":
      address  => '10.0.0.10',
      insecure => true,
    }

    # port can be specified
    unbound::stub { "0.0.10.in-addr.arpa.":
      address  => '10.0.0.10@10053',
      insecure => true,
    }

    # address can be an array.
    # in the following case, generated conf would be as follows:
    #
    #   stub-host: ns1.example.com
    #   stub-addr: 10.0.0.10@10053
    #   stub-host: ns2.example.com
    #
    # note that conf will be generated in the same order provided.
    unbound::stub { "10.0.10.in-addr.arpa.":
      address => [ 'ns1.example.com', '10.0.0.10@10053', 'ns2.example.com' ],
    }

```

Or, using hiera
```yaml
unbound::stub:
  '10.0.10.in-addr.arpa.':
    address:
      - 'ns1.example.com'
      - '10.0.0.10@10053'
      - 'ns2.example.com'
```

Unless you have DNSSEC for your private zones, they are considered insecure,
noted by `insecure => true`.

### Static DNS records

For overriding DNS record in zone.

```puppet
    unbound::record { 'test.example.tld':
        type => 'A',
        content => '10.0.0.1',
        ttl => '14400',
    }
```

Or, using hiera
```yaml
unbound::record:
  'test.example.tld':
    type: 'A'
    content: '10.0.0.1'
    ttl: '14400'
```

### Forward Zones

Setup a forward zone with a list of address from which you should resolve queries.  You can configure a forward zone with something like the following:

```puppet
    unbound::forward { '.':
      address => [
        '8.8.8.8',
        '8.8.4.4'
        ]
    }
```

Or, using hiera
```yaml
unbound::forward:
  '.':
    address:
      - '8.8.8.8'
      - '8.8.4.4'
```

This means that your server will use the Google DNS servers for any
zones that it doesn't know how to reach and cache the result.


### Fine grain access-control

```puppet
    class { "unbound":
      interface => ["::0","0.0.0.0"],
      access    => ["10.0.0.0/20", "10.0.0.5/32 reject", "::1 allow_snoop"],
    }
```

The access option allows to pass the action for each subnets, if the action is not provided we assume itâ€™s 'allow'.

### Adding arbitrary unbound configuration parameters

```puppet
    class { "unbound":
      interface => ["::0","0.0.0.0"],
      access    => ["10.0.0.0/20","::1"],
      custom_server_conf => [ 'include: "/etc/unbound/conf.d/*.conf"' ],
    }
```

The _custom_server_conf_ option allows the addition of arbitrary configuration parameters to your server configuration. It expects an array, and each element gets added to the configuration file on a separate line. In the example above, we instruct Unbound to load other configuration files from a subdirectory.

### Remote Control

The Unbound remote controls the use of the unbound-control utility to
issue commands to the Unbound daemon process.

```puppet
    class { "unbound::remote":
      enable => true,
    }
```

On some platforms this is needed to function correctly for things like service
reloads.

### Skipping hints download

In the case you're only building a caching forwarder and don't do iterative lookups you might not want to download the hints file containing the root nameservers because you don't need it, or you also might not be able to download it anyway because your server is firewalled which would cause the module would hang on trying to download the hints file. To skip the download set the skip_roothints_download parameter to true.

```puppet
    class { "unbound":
      skip_roothints_download => true,
    }
```
