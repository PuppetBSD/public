    puppet-swift supports Ubuntu 16.04 xenial
features:
  - Previous version of puppet-swift hard coded
    upstart for ubuntu, that restriction is removed
    for ubuntu now.  xenial will use systemd by default.
    'swiftinit' service provider now also supports
    xenial using systemd for service start at boot
    control.
