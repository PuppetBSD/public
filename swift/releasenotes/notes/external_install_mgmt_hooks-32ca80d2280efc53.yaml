    Add hooks for external install & svc management.
features:
  - This adds defined anchor points for external modules to
    hook into the software install, config and service dependency
    chain. This allows external modules to manage software
    installation (virtualenv, containers, etc) and service management
    (pacemaker) without needing rely on resources that may change or
    be renamed.
